# Project: Operationalizing Machine Learning
## Name: Eduardo Cortez 

For the Operationalizing Machine Learning we are working with the bank marketing data set. Within this dataset the target variable is represented by the column 'y' which denotes whether a client subscribed to a term deposit or not. We are seeking to create a model to predict this target for new customers. We leverage the efficiency of AutoMl to identify the best model and then deploy the model, consume the endpoints, and create automation with pipelines.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
